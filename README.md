## About The Project

![Main Page](showcase/1.png)

This repo serves as the template for your brand-new bakery-type shop.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating other important aspects of the shop than creating and listing products.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
